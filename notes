- to be able to see that all the lines of code got tested and all the functions ran accordingly
    go to the package.json file > "test" section > write "jest --coverage" (which is a jest property)
        now its making sure that everything gets checked
            by adding the "--coverage" to the "test": "jest" section
            it automatically adds a coverage folder
                and lookup unitTestingJS > coverage > Icov-report > index.html and then go to liveServer
                    this will give you a webpage for the stats of your code coverage

- add a unnessicary function to the js file sum called helper
    - run a npm test in your terminal
        -notice that the coverage table is different bc the function isn't being used
            -click on the sum.js in the browser and see all the lines of code that aren't being used (they're in red)
                -this is a big help for taking note if we are testing everything we want to test

- we do all of this to make sure that our code does what we want it to do

- this is all called unit testing
    unit testing is when you test the smallest unit of your code
        in this case its just a single function
            we are breaking our code down into really small components
